This folder contains the frontend of CareerFlow â€” a web application that helps students discover jobs, apply to positions, and helps recruiters post and manage job listings. The frontend is built with modern web tooling and a component-based architecture to keep the UI fast, accessible, and easy to extend.

## What this project is

- A responsive application that lists jobs, shows job details, supports applications, and provides dashboard pages for recruiters and applicants.
- Built using a component-driven approach (see `src/components`) and a central app context (`src/context/AppContext.jsx`).

## Quick features

- Job listing and search
- Recruiter job posting and management
- Application submission and viewing
- Simple authentication flows wired to the backend
